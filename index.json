Therefore, in this research, we aim at clarifying the elements required to evaluate the human impression of a robot's movements. In the experiment, we compare the impressions of participants who interacted with a robot with movements (behavior robot) and a robot without movements (non-behavior robot). As a result, we found out that when using the behavior robot, participants showed significantly higher values in their impressions of cheerfulness and sociability. Questionnaires about interaction have also revealed that adapting to individuals (personalization) is an important function for robots to make a good impression on humans.","tags":["Human-robot interaction","Human factors","Human centered robotics"],"title":"Impression evaluation of robot’s behavior when assisting human in a cooking task","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yue Hu","Naoko Abe","Mehdi Benallegue","Natsuki Yamanobe","Gentiane Venture","Eiichi Yoshida"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614556800,"objectID":"2a4201e847a5098788659501190a6a4d","permalink":"https://hu-yue.github.io/publication/2021hu_iftomm/","publishdate":"2021-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021hu_iftomm/","section":"publication","summary":"In the near future, robots may be used in environments where close contacts and interactions with humans will be inevitable, including unpredicted physical actions from the robot.

In trying to achieve safer physical interactions, often the robot is overly constrained in both speed and force, becoming rather” passive” when in direct contact with humans, where with direct contact we refer to the human physically touching the robot with their hands or other body parts.

Therefore, safety has been one of the main concerns, mainly when physical contact may happen or is necessary. Safety standards for collaborative robots have been introduced in ISO/TS 15066 in 2016, where a set of limitations and strict rules have been imposed. In the state-of-the-art research on HRI, physical humanrobot interaction (pHRI) is often more focused on the development of controllers, while social human-robot interaction (sHRI) is more focused on the evaluation of the perception, e.g. sense of comfort, safety of the user with respect to robots, often by means of post-experiment questionnaires. In sHRI there is generally no physical contact between the human and the robot, whereas in pHRI the social aspects are usually not taken into account, and robots are often overconstrained to ensure the aforementioned safety, becoming rather “passive” and “slow”. We believe that the efficiency of physical interaction with robots could be boosted with “active” interactions. We refer to this as active physical human-robot interaction (active pHRI), i.e. an interaction during which robots may take autonomous physical actions on the human without prior notifications. To this end, robots should be able to adapt to the human counterparts during the interaction, i.e. be “active” and at the same time be “human-aware”. In this work, we attempt at addressing the identification of possible useful interaction factors during active pHRI that could be used for the future development of active controllers, by combining methodologies from both sHRI and pHRI, analyzing the users’ state via both physiological data, physical data, and questionnaires. As physiological and physical data alone are of difficult interpretation, we try to find correlations that may give interesting insights.","tags":["pHRI","Human-robot interaction","Human factors","Human centered robotics","Coollaborative robot"],"title":"Interact with me: first insights into active pHRI","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giulio Romualdi","Stefano Dafarra","Yue Hu","Daniele Pucci"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"18fac86de1785288b599788b3071255e","permalink":"https://hu-yue.github.io/publication/2018romualdi_humanoids/","publishdate":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018romualdi_humanoids/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper contributes towards the development and comparison of Divergent-Component-of-Motion (DCM) based control architectures for humanoid robot locomotion.

Despite its abstract architecture, with prismatic joints combined with damped series elastic actuators instead of knees, the model (including dynamics and constraints) is suitable for describing both human and humanoid locomotion with appropriate parameters. We present and apply an inverse optimal control approach to identify optimality criteria based on human motion capture experiments. The identified optimal strategy is then transferred to a humanoid robot template model for gait generation by solving an optimal control problem, which takes into account the properties of the robot and differences in the environment. The results of this step are the center-of-mass trajectory, the foot trajectories, the torso orientation, and the single and double support phase durations for a sequence of steps, allowing the humanoid robot to walk within a new environment.

However, they are very conservative and do not allow to exploit the whole-body dynamics of the robot as well as more dynamic walking motions, e.g. often the upper body of the robot does not perform any motion. Whole-body dynamic models are still computationally expensive to be used in an online fashion. However, with a precise description of the dynamic model of the robot, whole-body models have been used to generate feasible and dynamically challenging motions by means of optimal control. The iCub humanoid robot is a child-size robot designed and produced by the Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT). The robot has a special design of Series Elastic Actuators (SEA) in the knee and ankle pitch joints of each leg, which allows to remove the spring, giving the possibility of using both compliant and rigid actuators. In previous works it has been shown that iCub is capable of walking in different environments, by means of simplified models. By means of optimal control and whole-body models with reduced sets of DOF, also motions considering the SEA have been generated for the HeiCub robot. Walking with SEA actuators has been demonstrated to be feasible on the CoMan humanoid robot by means of kinematic primitives.

All locomotion systems are governed by complex nonlinear, hybrid dynamics, and are redundant, underactuated and often unstable, which makes their control a very challenging task. The chapter starts with a presentation of different concepts of stability and robustness of locomotion considering nominal walking situations as well as the reaction to larger external perturbations. Then, optimal control is discussed as a guiding principle of human and robot motion, and dynamic multibody system models as well as different optimization problem formulations for the generation, control and analysis of locomotion are shown. Constant or variable compliance plays an important role in biological and bio-inspired locomotion, but needs to be properly adapted in the design and control process which also can be addressed by optimal control. Next, impedance control in locomotion is discussed, looking at passive and active impedance and different approaches to emulated appropriate impedances for robots. The chapter also reviews control approaches for legged locomotion based on template models, i.e. very simple representations of the original locomotor system, with a focus using template models for the design of suitable controllers. The state of the art of passive dynamic walking robots as well as powered and almost passive dynamic robots is summarized and their achievements in terms of energy-efficiency, stability, robustness and versatility re discussed. Hybrid zero dynamics is presented as a control synthesis framework that reduces the complexity of whole-body dynamics control and allows to develop efficient controllers for dynamic walking and running motions. Finally, a control approach for locomotion based on the concept of central pattern generators is presented which helps to control locomotion of legged robots and gives insight into human movement control.","tags":["Humanoid robot","Bipedal locomotion","Optimal control","Human motion analysis","Joint stiffness"],"title":"Control of Motion and Compliance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yue Hu","Jorhabib Eljaik","Kevin Stein","Francesco Nori","Katja Mombaur"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477958400,"objectID":"384f8ea1569f8b7635132d03a7e32ad5","permalink":"https://hu-yue.github.io/publication/2016hu_humanoids/","publishdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016hu_humanoids/","section":"publication","summary":"The humanoid robot iCub is a research platform of the Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), spread among different institutes around the world. In the most recent version of iCub, the robot is equipped with stronger legs and bigger feet, allowing it to perform balancing and walking motions that were not possible with the first generations. Despite the new legs hardware, walking has been rarely performed on the iCub robot. In this work the objective is to implement walking motions on the robot, from which we want to analyze its walking capabilities. We developed software modules based on extensions of classic techniques such as the ZMP based pattern generator and position control to identify which are the characteristics as well as limitations of the robot against different walking tasks in order to give the users a reference of the performance of the robot. Most of the experiments have been performed with HeiCub, a reduced version of iCub without arms and head.","tags":["Humanoid robot","Bipedal locomotion"],"title":"Walking of the iCub humanoid robot in different scenarios: Implementation and performance analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yue Hu","Katja Mombaur"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1467331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467331200,"objectID":"754acb37fe0ae13aa7c3e62a25a93217","permalink":"https://hu-yue.github.io/publication/2016hu_psyco/","publishdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016hu_psyco/","section":"publication","summary":"Compliance at joint level in human locomotion has played a central role in many studies. In particular joints in the lower body were mainly considered in order to create mechanisms able to reproduce human-like gaits such as prostheses, exoskeletons or walking robots. In a previous study, we have used an 11 DOF 2D human model to carry out the analysis of compliance in the leg joints during level ground walking, by introducing torsional springs with variable stiffness in the leg joints and dampers in the ankle joints. In this paper we have significantly extended this study to different walking scenarios, such as slope and stair walking, in addition to level ground walking. In the dynamic model, two degrees of freedom have been added to the trunk in order to better reproduce the flexibility of the human trunk, resulting in a 13 DOF 2D human model. In addition, biarticular springs as coupling between hip and knee joints have been introduced. Optimal control is applied to identify the stiffness profiles, the rest positions of the springs and the value of the damper at the ankle that best reproduce measured human joint trajectories in these walking scenarios.","tags":["Bipedal locomotion","Optimal control","Human motion analysis","Joint stiffness"],"title":"Analysis of human leg joints compliance in different walking scenarios with an optimal control approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yue Hu","Francesco Nori","Katja Mombaur"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464739200,"objectID":"de67b4abb3e9077405908bbb4045f234","permalink":"https://hu-yue.github.io/publication/2016hu_biorob/","publishdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016hu_biorob/","section":"publication","summary":"In the recent version of the iCub humanoid robot of the Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Series Elastic Actuators (SEA) have been introduced in the knee and ankle pitch joints.

Most of these robots are meant to serve humans, and so to work safely in close contact with humans. This motivated many researchers to focus their work on safe humanrobot interactions, including development of compliant actuators. Different from rigid actuators, they have elastic elements which can absorb shocks and be possibly advantageous from the energy consumption point of view. One well known compliant actuator is the Series Elastic Actuator (SEA), which introduces a spring in the actuator. In the iCub robot built by the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) a customized version of these actuators was introduced in the knee and ankle joints in a new version of the legs, replacing the previous rigid actuators.

This problem is usually solved by introducing actuation redundancy, which involves force control algorithms. Another approach is the selection of the best actuation modes along a trajectory to be followed with regard to the kinetostatic, elastostatic and dynamic performances of the parallel manipulator. Accordingly, this paper introduces a three degree-of-freedom planar parallel manipulator with variable actuation modes, named NAVARO. NAVARO stands for NAntes Variable Actuation RObot and has eight actuation modes. First, the prototype of the manipulator is presented. Then, its transmission systems are presented. The kinematic and dynamic models of the NAVARO are developed. Finally, an algorithm for multiobjective actuation mode selection based on graph theory is detailed.","tags":["Parallel robot","Algorithm","Redundancy"],"title":"Algorithm for the Actuation Mode Selection of the Parallel Manipulator NAVARO","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yue Hu","Martin Felis","Katja Mombaur"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1414800000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1414800000,"objectID":"82c7fa4adc1bcabad4de08b034959351","permalink":"https://hu-yue.github.io/publication/2014hu_humanoids/","publishdate":"2014-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014hu_humanoids/","section":"publication","summary":"Compliance is a property of human locomotion that has been largely investigated, both at muscle and joint level. Many studies are focused on leg joints in order to create mechanisms able to reproduce human-like gaits such as prostheses, exoskeletons or walking robots. A common approach is to look for a suitable stiffness for a linear spring that can approximate the behavior of a specific joint in a certain walking phase. In this paper the objective is instead to analyze the modulation of stiffness in the joints of human lower limbs during a single ground level walking step. Torsional springs with variable stiffness are introduced in the hip, knee and ankle joints of a 2D human model, as well as a damper in the ankle joint to avoid oscillations. Optimal control is applied to compute the variable stiffness, the rest positions of the springs and the value of the damper at the ankle that best reproduce human joint trajectories during level ground walking.","tags":["Bipedal locomotion","Optimal control","Human motion analysis","Joint stiffness"],"title":"Compliance analysis of human leg joints in level ground walking with an optimal control approach","type":"publication"}]
